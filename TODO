- Constructive Solid Geometry (Boolean shapes)
- Depth of field
- Linear transformations of objects
- Custom camera position and orientation, field-of-view, image dimensions
- Haze/fog
- Optimizations: precompute more things
- More advanced specular lighting, e.g. Cook-Torrance
- Super-sampling
- Profile to find bottlenecks + optimize
- Other shapes, e.g. triangles, cylinders
- Textures, perhaps programmatically generated, e.g. checkerboard
- Maybe fractals as textures
- Maybe 3D fractals (Mandelbulb etc.)
- Stereo vision
